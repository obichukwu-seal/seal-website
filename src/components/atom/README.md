An atom is indeed the smallest unit of matter, and all matter is composed of atoms.

Regarding the folder structure:

This folder is intended to contain all lower-level components, which are the fundamental building blocks of the application. Examples include:

- Cards
- Wrappers
- List items

The index file at the root (atom/index) primarily serves for globally exporting the components from this folder.
